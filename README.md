# Nightfall

**DEPRECATED**: nightfall is currently deprecated, as we favor [jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) with [Apache Toree](https://toree.apache.org/) instead.

Nightfall is a Valyrian steel longsword belonging to House Harlaw. It is currently wielded by Ser Harras Harlaw.

Developed initally by team Greyjoy, provides dependency injection and configuration for Spark.
